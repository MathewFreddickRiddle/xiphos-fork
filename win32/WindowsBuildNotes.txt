Currently we are stuck with GTK 2 on Windows, because of HTML display widget
weirdness. All necesssary packages are currently available in cross-compile
mode (from the mingw32/64 packages) on Fedora 30, with the exception of
Biblesync. Since that's our own, and it's very small, we can get away with
building that as a part of this process.

The script "xc-xiphos-win.sh" in this directory will take care of doing the
building for you. If you are running Fedora 30 on the current host, you should
be able to go ahead and invoke the script in the appropriate manner. You will
need password-less sudo access on the current machine for the script to execute,
as it will update all packages, install all necessary dependencies, build BibleSync,
and and then build Xihpos windows packages. Those binaries will end up inside
the root of the xiphos/ source folder.

Because you probably don't want to mess up your current local system to run
the builds, invoking this script from either a VM or a Fedora 30 container is
the best option. Try this command, or substitute your favorite container
runtime command:

mkdir win
cd win
git clone https://github.com/crosswire/xiphos.git
git clone https://github.com/karlkleinpaste/biblesync.git
docker run --rm -it -v .:/source fedora:30 /source/xihpos/win32/xc-xiphos-win.sh -win32 -win64 -b=/source/biblesync

Similar behavior can be achieved through a Fedora 30 VM, or using podman, or
similar.
